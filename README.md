# image-processing-api
An API that can be used in two different ways. As a simple placeholder API, the first allows to place images into the frontend with the size set via URL parameters (and optional additional stylization) for rapid prototyping. The second use case is as a library to serve properly scaled versions of images to the front end to reduce page load size.
